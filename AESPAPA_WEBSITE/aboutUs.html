        <div class="center-text">
            <p>Welcome to Pinoy Recipe! We are a group of passionate individuals who turned our love for Filipino food into a meaningful endeavor. What started as a shared hobby during our college days has now become a platform dedicated to showcasing the best of Filipino cuisine. Back in college, we would bond over trying out recipes, hosting small food tastings, and dreaming of sharing our culture with a wider audience.</p>
            <p>After graduating, we decided to take this passion to the next level, combining our knowledge and creativity to bring authentic Filipino flavors to everyone’s table. At Pinoy Recipe, we celebrate the rich traditions of Filipino cooking while embracing new ways to make these dishes accessible and enjoyable for all.
            <p>Our journey is deeply rooted in the values of family, community, and culture. Each recipe we share is a tribute to the dishes we grew up with, lovingly prepared by our elders, and now passed down to the next generation. We aim to connect with Filipinos worldwide and introduce our vibrant cuisine to those discovering it for the first time. With every recipe, we share not only the taste but also the stories and memories that make Filipino food truly special.</p>
